# Spatial Analysis in Habitat Suitability of the Horned Grebe
## Project Overview

The Horned Grebe (Podiceps auritus) is an emblematic bird species of British Columbia's (BC) diverse ecosystems, now facing the precarious status of being endangered. Our research is dedicated to understanding the habitat needs of this species, with the intent to guide conservation efforts effectively.

BC's rich ecological tapestry, from its coastal wetlands to its freshwater systems, presents an ideal living laboratory to study the Grebe in the context of varied environmental conditions that shape its existence.

## Objectives

- To analyze the correlation between the Horned Grebe's habitat suitability and key environmental factors: elevation, forest cover, Human Footprint Index (HFI), and distance to water bodies.
- To harness a comprehensive dataset of endangered bird observations, focusing on the Horned Grebe to evaluate its habitat preferences and survival strategies over the course of a year.
- To offer actionable insights for conservation strategies and habitat management, aiming to bolster the survival prospects of the Horned Grebe in BC.

## Repository Contents
- Data: The raw and processed datasets of the Horned Grebe observations, along with the environmental covariates.
- Scripts: R scripts and Jupyter notebooks containing the analyses performed, including spatial modeling and statistical testing.
- Results: Visualizations and results files, detailing the findings of the habitat suitability analysis.
- Docs: Documentation on the methodology, including detailed explanations of the statistical approaches and modeling techniques used.
